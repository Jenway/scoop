These apps are deprecated because they are no longer maintained or have been replaced by other apps.

| App Name | Description | Install Command |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- |
|Clash For Windows |You Know What It Is.| `scoop install jenway_scoop/clash-for-windows` |
|Clash for Windows_Chinese |You Know What It Is.| `scoop install jenway_scoop/clash-for-windows-chinese` |

These apps are deprecated because scoop seems not really suitable for handling them.

> Now I recommend using [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) to install these GUI apps.
